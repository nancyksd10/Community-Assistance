                <li><strong>The Utilization of Time:</strong> Most of the time, the students are found wasting their time. They are either sitting and gossiping or roaming the streets with their friends. This is a sheer wastage of time. These tasks do not bear any fruit to them. The power of the youth of the country is also being wasted like this. It is better to do some fruitful task instead of wasting time. In this case, nothing can be better than doing social work or social services. While doing work for the social benefit of the people, they are utilizing their time in a very efficient manner. They are helping others. While doing social work, the students feel contented. It gives them a very nice feeling.</li>
                <li><strong>It gives Satisfaction to the Students:</strong> The students feel satisfied when they help in social services or participate in social work. The students feel that they have some role in the society. They feel that the society needs them and they feel satisfied with it. It is very common to hear from the students that the country is corrupt, there is no system in the country, and the country is not worth living. But when the students participate in social, they will think that they are working for the benefit of the country. They think that they are working for the bright future of the country. They will feel satisfied that at least they have taken a step which will improve the country's future. It will fill their mind and heart with satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>It gives Motivation to the Students:</strong> There are some students in the society who feel that they cannot do any work. They feel that they are not fit for any work. They lack motivation. Due to lack of motivation, the students leave a task in the middle of the performance. This motivation can be provided with social services. While participating in social services, the students have to complete their task. When they complete a whole task, they feel motivated. They think that they can help others very well. They feel motivated to manage a system of people. It also makes them feel that they are fit for all other works. It provides them with motivation.</li>
                <li><strong>It gives Inspiration to the Students:</strong> Everyone needs some inspiration in their life. Inspiration is very necessary for life. As our country needs youth power, the youth power can be inspired from social services. Social work fills the students with enthusiasm to work for the country or to make it a better place for living. They will make their existence meaningful to the country.</li>

        <div style="font-size: 3rem; font-weight: bold;color: red;">Students can do What Government cannot!</div> 
        <hr>
        <div style="font-size: 1.15rem;">The government of the country has to deal with the whole population of the country. It has to manage the whole country. In such a situation, it is very difficult for the government to check that each and every group in the country is happy and contented. So the students can do what the government cannot do. The students can work for the betterment of the groups of people residing in the area surrounding them. The government cannot personally see that each and every person in the society is educated. But the students can teach the illiterate people around them how to read, write and count. They may also teach them the basic arithmetic. Teaching the people in this way is beyond the scope of the government but it is very easy for the students. The students may also make the people aware of their basic human rights and duties.  They can educate the women about the various laws which have been formulated for their safety and benefit. They should spread awareness for the right to education. They may spread awareness about sanitation. They can tell the people about the harms of using open lands or fields for sanitation and the health risk associated with it. They can motivate the people to build toilets and use them. They can tell the benefits of living in the clean environment. These small steps taken by the students will definitely help the country. It is very difficult for the government to take care of all these neither the government can take care of all the people of the country on a personal level. <b>But, the students can do it.</b></div>
